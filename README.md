This repo is now archieved.

I am no longer a user of [Koken](http://koken.me/) and have migrated my Gallery to [Yapawa](https://yapawa.net/), a gallery site that I developped.

Thank you Koken Team for your awesome tool that allowed me to host my pictures during many years.

This plugin provides a CSS to *unhide* albums titles on the Koken Adminstration site in the Library panel.

By default, only the sort field is shown, but album names is still important.
